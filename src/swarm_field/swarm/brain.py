"""The composed robot brain (A).

``ComposedAgent`` is the thin orchestrator that implements the ``SwarmAgent`` boundary. At each
decision point it merges what the robot sensed and received into its memory, keeps the field
provider's quadtree in sync with new terrain facts, gathers the scored candidates of its
behaviors, lets its arbiter pick one and turns its intent into one action: the navigator steps
along the field a ``FollowField`` names, and any other intent passes through. It broadcasts its
status (its cell, and the winner's target and objective) and its memory, and merges what its
peers broadcast. Capability gating is added once it is built.
